# AmethystOS 

## What is it?

AmethystOS is an open-source operating system that has a "hand-made" kernel. It is made to run on Raspberry (Pi 3 and 4) ArmV8 (AArch64). It is possible that the OS works on other systems, but I would not have tested them...

This is mostly a fun little project rather than the next masterpiece! AmethystOS may be the equivalent of MS-DOS one day... But it's not sure!

## Small Q&A

These questions about AmethystOS are mine, nobody has asked me about this OS yet.

### Is this a Linux distribution?

The bootloader, kernel and OS are made by me, but some parts of the code will not be from me (inspired or copied), the credits will be notified in the files and here.
It will probably take some commands and syntax from Unix/Linux and Windows for ease of use (why reinvent the wheel?)
